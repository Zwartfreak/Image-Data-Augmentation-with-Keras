# Image-Data-Augmentation-with-Keras

## Keras
Keras is an open-source neural-network library written in Python. It is capable of running on top of TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, R, Theano, or PlaidML. Designed to enable fast experimentation with deep neural networks, it focuses on being user-friendly, modular, and extensible.

## Problem Statement
Sometimes we lack with number of images to train our model which decreases its accuracy. We have to provide the model with enough number of training sets so that it could perform better. But sometimes, due to lack of resources of datasets, we are unable to collect too many or enough training data.

## Solution
This notebook basically shows what to do when we don't have enough dataset to train our model. With `Keras`, we can multiply our dataset 2x, 4x or 5x times. This might help us in increasing the accuracy of the model by providing it with more number of training images.
