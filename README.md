# Image-Data-Augmentation-with-Keras

## Keras
Keras is an open-source neural-network library written in Python. It is capable of running on top of TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, R, Theano, or PlaidML. Designed to enable fast experimentation with deep neural networks, it focuses on being user-friendly, modular, and extensible.

This notebook basu=ically shows what to do when we don't have enough dataset to train our model. Sometimes we lack with number of images to train our model which decreases its accuracy. With `Keras`, we can multiply our dataset 2x, 4x or 5x times. This might help us in increasing the accuracy of the model by providing it with more number of training images.
